## Pixel
> Full documentation [here](https://pixel.js.org/ "Full documentation.").

An open-source **Discord bot**, written with: Library: **Discord.js**, Framework: **Patron.js**.

### Note
- This branch is fully completed and will only recieve updates that continue to allow the code to actually run.
- The [rewrite branch](https://github.com/LumiteDubbz/Pixel/tree/rewrite/) will be actively developed.

### Getting started
> Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "Node.js' homepage.") and [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git's homepage.") for your OS.
> More detailed setup is available on the full setup documentation [here](https://pixel.js.org/setup/ "Setup documentation.").

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/LumiteDubbz/Pixel`.
2. Open the folder, once unzipped, in a code editor of your choice, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VS Code's homepage.").
3. Open the `credentials_example.json` file and rename it to `credentials.json`. Now, edit this and replace the pseudo credentials with the correct details.
4. Open the Terminal, change directory into the location of the repository clone, for example: `cd Documents/GitHub/Pixel`.
5. Start the bot: `npm start` *or* `node src/app.js` (longer to type, faster to run the bot.)
